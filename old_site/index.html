		<h3>About me</h3>
		<p>Hi! I'm Sven. I'm a third year computer science Ph.D. student at <a href="http://iub.edu">Indiana University</a>. I have a B.Eng. degree with a focus in media and imaging technology from Cologne University of Applied Sciences in Germany (2010) and a M.S. in computer science from Indiana University (2013).</p>

		<hr />

		<a name="research"></a>
		<h3>Research</h3>
		<p>My main research interest is <a href="http://vision.soic.indiana.edu">computer vision</a>, i.e. the subset of computer science and artificial intelligence that tries to come up with methods of analyzing and understanding images. I am advised by <a href="https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~djcran/">David Crandall</a>.</p>

		<p>Originating from a collaboration with <a href="http://psych.indiana.edu/faculty/chenyu.php">Chen Yu</a> and his <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~dll/">Computational Cognition and Learning Laboratory</a> comes a specialization in egocentric video. I am interested in why, how and when we look at things (and also how infants learn to do so) and how I can use computer vision algorithms to predict or emulate human behavior. Some topics of current research are visual saliency as a measure of gaze prediction, robust hand tracking and hand-gaze correlations, the role of optical flow in egocentric video.</p>

		<a name="employment"></a>
		<h3>Employment</h3>
		<p>From fall 2011 to spring 2013, I worked as a teaching assistant (officially called associate instructor) at IU (see <a href="#teaching">Teaching</a>). Since June 2013, I have been employed as a research assistant.</p>

		<p>In the time between graduating with my bachelor's degree in Germany and coming to the US (01/2011 - 06/2011), I worked as a self-employed media engineer. My main client was <a href="http://almoe.de">almö GmbH</a>.</p>

		<p>Finally, here are some internships that I did during my time as an undergraduate engineering student at Cologne University of Applied Sciences:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b><a href="http://www.meta-fusion.com/">meta-fusion GmbH</a> 05/2009 - 08/2009, internship:</b> meta-fusion is a service provider for multi-media and internet applications and specializes in internet video streaming of big conferences. I worked both with the technical staff on location (United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009 in Bonn, Germany) as well as with the research/developement department.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b><a href="http://www.nexum.de/en.html?no_cache=1">nexum AG</a> 01/2007 - 06/2007 (internship), 06/2008 - 11/2011 (student assistant):</b> nexum is a big consultancy and agency for digital media. I worked in the developement department and was responsible for the planning and implementation of large scale internet solutions.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<a name="teaching"></a>
		<h3>Teaching</h3>
		<p>During my first two years at Indiana University, I helped teaching the following courses as an associate instructor:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Fall 11: </b>CSCI P573 - "Scientific Computing" with <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~bramley/">Prof. Bramley</a></li>
			<li><b>Spring 12: </b>CSCI A321 - "Computing Tools for Scientific Research" with <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~bramley/">Prof. Bramley</a></li>
			<li><b>Fall 12: </b>CSCI C211 - "Introduction to Computer Science" with <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~menzel/">Prof. Menzel</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~sabry/">Prof. Sabry</a> (included preparing and teaching labs)</li>
			<li><b>Spring 13: </b>CSCI C211 - "Introduction to Computer Science" with Prof. Lara-Dammer (included preparing and teaching labs)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Fun</h3>
		<p>I don't only like to analyze images, I also like taking them. Although I took some photography classes as an undergraduate, I am far from being a professional. However, I am a proud owner of a Canon SLR camera and a very sparse collection of my photos can be seen on my <a href="http://www.svenbambach.com">personal website</a>.</p>

		<p>I recently started biking as I discovered that it's by far the most fun "basic" outdoor activity to me and Bloomington actually has some really nice bike trails. The "normal" tour that I try to do daily is about 18.5km. Not bad I guess.</p>

		<p>Inspired by playing foosball inbetween classes, my friend and I developed a software capable of tracking all key components of a foosball game in real time (30+ FPS). It was a project for a computer vision class we took in the spring 12 term. A video of our results can be seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q80WH4OIqJM">here</a>.</p>
